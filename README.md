# JS-interview-prep-guide
This repository is created to provide a guidance path in JavaScript interview preparation. It accumulates key points that we may learn/revisit to prepare for JavaScript interviews. You may find folders that represents each category which will have related topics/ tricky questions provided. We believe providing answers along with the questions may downgrade your overall preparation hence all collaborators are only focusing on contributing questions / topics. It is expected that anybody who is following the document will prepare by themselves. Though if you are stuck with any question feel free to reach out to dip686@gmail.com, I will revert back to you after 1 day with the solution. We have decided to keep the 1 day reverting time just to ensure you will at least put in enough effort to figure out solution of this specific question.
